\textbf{Attacker's (RPD~\cite{rationalprotocol}) utility:}

As given by the environment (is that possible/sensible?) minus:

\begin{itemize}
  \item If $Eve$ cheats $Bob$, this causes a grim trigger by $Bob$ (he never buys again
  from her)
  \item If $Eve$ has $Bob$ choose her next or blocks others and soon later $Bob$ finds out
  that more vendors are available (heuristic), he then excludes $Eve$ for a number of his
  buys (how many?)
\end{itemize}

Problems: the above solutions do not directly tax the utility of the adversary, but change
the actual functionality...
