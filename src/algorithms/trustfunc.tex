(*@$\mathcal{F}_{Trust}$ \Reactivatenumber@*)
Has oracle access to the players' utility functions (*@$U$@*)

Upon receiving chooseBestSeller((*@$d$@*), (*@$L$@*)) from (*@$Alice$@*):
  choose (*@$Bob \in L$@*) that will maximise (*@$U_{Alice}$@*) after the transaction (goes through with the trade and offers the minimum price and maximum quality of product)
  If (*@$U_{Alice, before} > U_{Alice, after}$@*):
    (*@$Bob$@*) = (*@$\bot$@*)
  send message bestSeller((*@$d$@*), (*@$L$@*), (*@$Bob$@*)) to (*@$Alice$@*)
\end{lstlisting}

Assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Trades are atomic. $\mathcal{F}_{Trust}$ can deterministically decide whether
  $Bob$ will complete the trade.
  \item The internal workings of $\mathcal{F}_{Trust}$ is common knowledge to the players.
  Their utility depends on it.
\end{itemize}
Note: It would be interesting to see how utilities (as algorithms) and
$\mathcal{F}_{Trust}$ have a "fixed point".
