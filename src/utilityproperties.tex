\section{Utility Function Properties}
  Before $Alice$ (an ITM that executes $\Pi_{SAT}$) can take any action, she must be
  assigned a utility function and a discount function by $\mathcal{E}$. We denote these
  functions with $U_{Alice}$ and $\lambda_{Alice}$ respectively.
  \begin{definition}[Utility Function]
    $U_{Alice} : Money \times multiset\left(Asset\right) \times Rep \rightarrow
    Utility$, where $Money, Rep \in \mathbb{N}, Utility \in \mathbb{R}$.
  \end{definition}
  The utility function is strictly increasing with respect to the integer $Money$ and may
  do anything with respect to the quantity of any single $Asset$ or combination of
  $Asset$s. It is also strictly increasing with respect to the integer $Rep$.

  $Rep$ is an integer that corresponds to $Alice$'s perceived rank in a partial ordering
  of all the players where $Alice$ assumes that she has a higher rank than $Bob$ if the
  average probability of third players choosing her before $Bob$ when they want to buy
  something amongst a list of $Asset$s that $Alice$ is interested in selling is higher
  than $Bob$'s corresponding probability for the same $Asset$s, as perceived by $Alice$.

  \begin{definition}[Discount function]
    $\lambda_{Alice} : Time \rightarrow \left[0, 1\right]$, where $Time \in \mathbb{N}$
    and $\lambda$ is strictly decreasing.
  \end{definition}
  \begin{definition}[State]
  Let $state_{Alice} : Time \rightarrow Money \times multiset\left(Asset\right) \times
  Rep$.
  \end{definition}
  $Alice$'s target is to maximise
  \begin{equation*}
    \sum\limits_{t = 1}^{\infty}
    \lambda_{Alice}\left(t\right)\left(\sum\limits_{\overset{\left(m, a, r\right)
    \in}{Money \times mset\left(Asset\right) \times Rep}} U_{Alice}\left(m, a,
    r\right) \cdot \Pr\left[state_{Alice}\left(t\right) = \left(m, a,
    r\right)\right]\right) \enspace.
  \end{equation*}
