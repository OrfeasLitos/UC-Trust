\section{$\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{SAT}}$ and $\Pi_{\mathrm{SAT}}$ are potentially
distinguishable}
  Consider the hybrid world of Fig.~\ref{fig:allfuncs} (right) with $n$ ITMs executing
  $\Pi_{\mathrm{SAT}}$, where $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{Trust}}$ is replaced by
  $\mathcal{F}'_{\mathrm{Trust}}$:
  \subimport{algorithms/}{badtrustfunc.tex}
  We will show here that $\mathcal{E}$ can distinguish between
  $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{SAT}}$ and a $\Pi_{\mathrm{SAT}}$ that uses
  $\mathcal{F}'_{\mathrm{Trust}}$.
  \begin{proof}[Distinguishability]
    Consider the following adversary and environment:
    \subimport{algorithms/}{distadv.tex}
    \subimport{algorithms/}{distenv.tex}

    Because of the way $\mathcal{E}$ is built, there always exists a seller ($Bob$) that
    can satisfy the desire of the buyer ($Alice$).

    In case $\mathcal{E}$ interacts with $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{SAT}}$, then $\mathcal{A}$
    will always match the buyer and the seller because of the way the former is built.
    Additionally, the price of 1 is cheap enough for $Alice$ to want to buy the asset,
    since she values acquiring one asset more than one coin.

    Furthermore, $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{SAT}}$ never cheats on a trade, thus the exchange
    will always complete correctly and $\mathcal{E}$ will receive \texttt{satisfied} as
    response. $\mathcal{E}$ will always correctly output \texttt{functionality}.

    On the other hand, in case $\mathcal{E}$ interacts with $\Pi_{\mathrm{SAT}}$, then we
    observe that $\mathcal{F}'_{\mathrm{Trust}}$ does not choose players depending on
    their reputation.  Thus, if $\mathcal{F}'_{\mathrm{Trust}}$ does not respond with
    $\bot$, it is always in $Bob$'s interest to cheat (since keeping the asset is
    preferrable to giving it) and $\mathcal{E}$ will always receive \texttt{cheated} as
    response. If $\mathcal{F}'_{\mathrm{Trust}}$ responds with $\bot$, the trade will not
    go through and $\mathcal{E}$ will receive \texttt{unsatisfied} as a response. In all
    cases $\mathcal{E}$ will correctly output \texttt{protocol}.
  \end{proof}
