\section{$\mathcal{F}_{SAT}$ and $\Pi_{SAT}$ are potentially distinguishable}
  Consider the hybrid world of Fig.~\ref{fig:allfuncs} (right) with $n$ ITMs executing
  $\Pi_{SAT}$, where $\mathcal{F}_{Trust}$ is replaced by $\mathcal{F}'_{Trust}$:
  \subimport{algorithms/}{badtrustfunc.tex}
  We will show here that $\mathcal{E}$ can distinguish between $\mathcal{F}_{SAT}$ and a
  $\Pi_{SAT}$ that uses $\mathcal{F}'_{Trust}$.
  \begin{proof}[Distinguishability]
    Consider the following adversary and environment:
    \subimport{algorithms/}{distadv.tex}
    \subimport{algorithms/}{distenv.tex}

    Because of the way $\mathcal{E}$ is built, there always exists a seller that can
    satisfy the desire of the buyer.

    In case $\mathcal{E}$ interacts with $\mathcal{F}_{SAT}$, then $\mathcal{A}$ will
    always match the buyer and the seller because of the way the former is built.
    Additionally, the price of 1 is cheap enough for the buyer to want to buy the asset.
    Furthermore, the boost in reputation is enough for the seller to not want to cheat,
    thus the exchange will always complete correctly and $\mathcal{E}$ will receive
    \texttt{satisfied} as response. $\mathcal{E}$ will always correctly output
    \texttt{functionality}.

    On the other hand, in case $\mathcal{E}$ interacts with $\Pi_{SAT}$, then
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $\mathcal{F}'_{Trust}$ does not modify the players' reputation and
      \item $\mathcal{F}'_{Trust}$ does not choose players depending on their reputation.
    \end{enumerate}
    Thus, if $\mathcal{F}'_{Trust}$ does not respond with $\bot$, it is always in the
    seller's interest to cheat and $\mathcal{E}$ will always receive \texttt{cheated} as
    response. If $\mathcal{F}'_{Trust}$ responds with $\bot$, the trade will not go
    through and $\mathcal{E}$ will receive \texttt{unsatisfied} as a response. In all
    cases $\mathcal{E}$ will correctly output \texttt{protocol}.
  \end{proof}
