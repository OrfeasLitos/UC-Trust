\section{$\mathcal{F}_{SAT}$ and $\Pi_{SAT}$ are potentially distinguishable}
  Consider the hybrid world of Fig.~\ref{fig:allfuncs} (right) with $n$ ITMs executing
  $\Pi_{SAT}$, where $\mathcal{F}_{Trust}$ is replaced by $\mathcal{F}'_{Trust}$:
  \subimport{algorithms/}{badtrustfunc.tex}
  We will show here that $\mathcal{E}$ can distinguish between $\mathcal{F}_{SAT}$ and a
  $\Pi_{SAT}$ that uses $\mathcal{F}'_{Trust}$.
  \begin{proof}[Distinguishability]
    Consider the following adversary and environment:
    \subimport{algorithms/}{distadv.tex}
    \subimport{algorithms/}{distenv.tex}

    Because of the way $\mathcal{E}$ is built, there always exists a seller ($Bob$) that
    can satisfy the desire of the buyer ($Alice$).

    In case $\mathcal{E}$ interacts with $\mathcal{F}_{SAT}$, then $\mathcal{A}$ will
    always match the buyer and the seller because of the way the former is built.
    Additionally, the price of 1 is cheap enough for $Alice$ to want to buy the asset,
    since she values acquiring one asset more than one coin.

    Furthermore, $\mathcal{F}_{SAT}$ never cheats on a trade, thus the exchange will
    always complete correctly and $\mathcal{E}$ will receive \texttt{satisfied} as
    response. $\mathcal{E}$ will always correctly output \texttt{functionality}.

    On the other hand, in case $\mathcal{E}$ interacts with $\Pi_{SAT}$, then we observe
    that $\mathcal{F}'_{Trust}$ does not choose players depending on their reputation.
    Thus, if $\mathcal{F}'_{Trust}$ does not respond with $\bot$, it is always in $Bob$'s
    interest to cheat (since keeping the asset is preferrable to giving it) and
    $\mathcal{E}$ will always receive \texttt{cheated} as response. If
    $\mathcal{F}'_{Trust}$ responds with $\bot$, the trade will not go through and
    $\mathcal{E}$ will receive \texttt{unsatisfied} as a response. In all cases
    $\mathcal{E}$ will correctly output \texttt{protocol}.
  \end{proof}
