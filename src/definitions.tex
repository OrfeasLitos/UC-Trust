\section{Trust definitions}
  We thus define two kinds of trust: direct and indirect. Direct trust from $Alice$ to $Bob$ is represented by input tokens
  (initially belonging to $Alice$) actively put by her in a common account from which $Bob$ can also take them. As long as
  $Bob$ does not take these tokens, $Alice$ directly trusts him equally to the amount of tokens deposited in the common
  account.
  
  This information can be used by another player $Charlie$ that directly trusts $Alice$ in order to derive information
  regarding $Bob$'s trustworthiness, even if $Charlie$ does not directly trust $Bob$. Through a transitive property, $Dean$,
  who directly trusts $Charlie$, can in turn derive information from the direct trust from $Alice$ to $Bob$. This reasoning can
  be extended to an arbitrary number of players, as long as they have at least one trust path to $Alice$. This is called
  indirect trust.

  \subimport{./definitions/}{indirecttrust.tex}

  By convention $DTr_{Alice \rightarrow Alice} = Tr_{Alice \rightarrow Alice}$ and are both equal to the quantity of input
  tokens $Alice$ has.

  We would like to provide players with an ideal functionality where they:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Directly trust tokens to another player
    \item Steal tokens previously directly entrusted by another player
    \item Retract tokens previously directly entrusted to another player
    \item Query indirect trust towards another player
  \end{enumerate}
  The following functionality provides such an interface:
