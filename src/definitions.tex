\section{Definitions}
  We thus define two kinds of trust: direct and indirect. Direct trust from $Alice$ to $Bob$ is represented by input tokens
  (initially belonging to $Alice$) actively given by her to an escrow from which $Bob$ can also take them. As long as $Bob$
  does not take these tokens, $Alice$ directly trusts him equally to the amount of tokens held by the escrow.
  
  This information can be used by another player $Charlie$ that directly trusts $Alice$ in order to derive information
  regarding $Bob$'s trustworthiness, even if $Charlie$ does not directly trust $Bob$. This is called indirect trust.

  We would like to provide players with an ideal functionality where they:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Directly trust coins to another player
    \item Steal coins previously entrusted by another player
    \item Retract coins previously entrusted to another player
    \item Query trust towards another player
  \end{enumerate}
  The following functionality provides such an interface:
