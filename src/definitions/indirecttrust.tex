\begin{definition}[Indirect Trust]
  The indirect trust from $Alice$ to $Bob$, $Tr_{Alice \rightarrow Bob}$, is measured in
  input tokens and can be calculated deterministically given the existing direct trusts
  between all pairs of players. It is equal to the number sent by $\mathcal{F}_{Trust}$ as
  a response to a message \emph{\texttt{query\_indirect\_trust(}$Alice$\texttt{,
  }$Bob$\texttt{)}}.
