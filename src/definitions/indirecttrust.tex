\begin{definition}[Indirect Trust]
  The indirect trust from $Alice$ to $Bob$, $Tr_{Alice \rightarrow Bob}$, is measured in input tokens and can be calculated
  deterministically given the existing direct trusts between all pairs of players. It is equal to the number sent by
  $\mathcal{F}_{Trust}$ as a response to a message \emph{\texttt{query\_indirect\_trust(}$Alice$\texttt{, }$Bob$\texttt{)}}.
