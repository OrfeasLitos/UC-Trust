\begin{definition}[Cost of desire]
  The cost of $Alice$'s indexed desire, say $\left(idx, d\right) \in \left(\mathbb{N}, \mathcal{D}\right)$, when satisfied by
  $Bob$ is equal to the input tokens that $Alice$ is required by $Bob$ to give to him in order for him to calculate
  $s\left(idx, d, Alice\right)$ and is represented by $c\left(idx, d, Alice, Bob\right)$. The cost of satisfying this desire
  herself is represented by $c\left(idx, d, Alice\right)$ and is equal to the number of computational steps $Alice$ must make
  in order to calculate $s\left(idx, d, Alice\right)$. Let $c\left(idx, d, Alice, Alice\right) = c\left(idx, d, Alice\right)$.
