\section{Protocol}
  In this section we will describe the real protocol executed by the players in the
  absence of the $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{SAT}}$ ideal functionality. The description of this
  protocol does not need any utility function; all the "important" decisions are taken by
  the environment.

  Consider an environment $\mathcal{E}$, and adversary $\mathcal{A}$ and $n$ players
  executing copies of the same protocol $\Pi_1, \dots, \Pi_n$. $\mathcal{E}$ can send the
  following messages to $\Pi_i$:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{msg:env:desires} Manage player desires
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \label{msg:env:desires:create} Satisfy $d \in \mathcal{D}$ through a player in
      $L \subseteq \left[n\right]$
      \item \label{msg:env:desires:abort} Abort attempt to satisfy $d \in \mathcal{D}$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Manage offered desires satisfaction
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Gain the ability to satisfy $d \in \mathcal{D}$ for players in $L \subseteq
      \left[n\right]$ for a price $x \in \mathbb{N}$
      \item Lose the ability to satisfy $d \in \mathcal{D}$ for players in $L \subseteq
      \left[n\right]$ for a price $x \in \mathbb{N}$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Satisfy another player's desire
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Satisfy player's $i \in \left[n\right]$ desire $d \in \mathcal{D}$ with the
      corresponding satisfaction string $s$
      \item Satisfy player's $i \in \left[n\right]$ desire $d \in \mathcal{D}$ with the
      satisfaction string $s'$ (normally suitable for satisfying $d' \neq d, d' \in
      \mathcal{D}$)
      \item Ignore player's $i \in \left[n\right]$ desire $d \in \mathcal{D}$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Manage direct trusts
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Increase direct trust to player $i \in \left[n\right]$ by $x \in \mathbb{N}$
      \item Decrease direct trust to player $i \in \left[n\right]$ by $x \in \mathbb{N}$
      \item Steal direct trust $x \in \mathbb{N}$ from player $i \in \left[n\right]$
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
  Some of these messages (e.g.~\ref{msg:env:desires:abort}) are meaningful only when some
  other messages have been delivered previously (e.g.~\ref{msg:env:desires:create}).
  $\mathcal{E}$ may send such messages even when they are not meaningful; the protocol
  should take care to reject/ignore such messages.

  Let $i \in \left[n\right]$. $\Pi_i$ can send the following messages to $\mathcal{E}$:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item No player in $L$ can satisfy my desire $d \in \mathcal{D}$
    \item Desire $d \in \mathcal{D}$ made available for satisfaction amongst $L \subseteq
    \left[n\right]$ for price $x \in \mathbb{N}$
    \item Desire $d \in \mathcal{D}$ made unavailable for satisfaction amongst $L \subseteq
    \left[n\right]$ for price $x \in \mathbb{N}$
    \item Payment $x \in \mathbb{N}$ has been sent to player $j \in \left[n\right]$ for
    the satisfaction of desire $d \in \mathcal{D}$
    \item Correct Payment $x \in \mathbb{N}$ from player $j \in \left[n\right]$ for
    the satisfaction of desire $d \in \mathcal{D}$ has been received
    \item Wrong Payment $x \in \mathbb{N}$ from player $j \in \left[n\right]$ for
    the satisfaction of desire $d \in \mathcal{D}$ has been received
    \item Player $j \in \left[n\right]$ has satisfied my desire $d \in \mathcal{D}$ with
    satisfaction string $s$
    \item Player $j \in \left[n\right]$ has partially satisfied my desire $d \in
    \mathcal{D}$ with satisfaction string $s'$ (normally suitable for satisfying $d' \neq
    d, d' \in \mathcal{D}$)
    \item Player $j \in \left[n\right]$ has ignored my desire $d \in \mathcal{D}$
    \item Direct trust to player $i \in \left[n\right]$ increased by $x \in \mathbb{N}$
    \item Direct trust to player $i \in \left[n\right]$ decreased by $x \in \mathbb{N}$
    \item Stole $x \in \mathbb{N}$ from player's $i \in \left[n\right]$ direct trust
  \end{enumerate}
  $\Pi_i$ should only send these messages when $\mathcal{E}$ is expecting them.

  Let $i, j \in \left[n\right]$ The messages that can be sent between $\Pi_i$ and $\Pi_j$
  are the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Can you satisfy $d \in \mathcal{D}$?
    \item I can satisfy $d \in \mathcal{D}$ for a price $x \in \mathbb{N}$
    \item I cannot satisfy $d \in \mathcal{D}$
    \item \label{msg:pl:pay} Payment of $x \in \mathbb{N}$ for satisfaction of $d \in \mathcal{D}$ sent
    \item \label{msg:pl:sat} Satisfaction string $s'$, response to payment of $x \in \mathbb{N}$ for $d \in
    \mathcal{D}$
  \end{enumerate}
  $\Pi_i$ is supposed to send~\ref{msg:pl:pay} when it has already paid through
  $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{Ledger}}$. Similarly, it is supposed to send~\ref{msg:pl:sat} when
  it has verified that the other party has sent the corresponding payment on
  $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{Ledger}}$.

  Going in more detail, the actual protocol is as follows:
