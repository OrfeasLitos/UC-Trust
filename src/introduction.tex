\section{Introduction}
  Consider the UC setting, with an environment $\mathcal{E}$, an adversary $\mathcal{A}$ and a set of ITIs that follow a
  given protocol $\Pi$.

  Intuitively, players spontaneously feel different desires of varying intensities and seek to satisfy them, either on their
  own, consuming part of their input tokens in the process, or by delegating the process to other players and paying them for
  their help with part of their input tokens. The choice depends on the perceived difference in price. Each player plays
  rationally, always attempting to maximize her utility.
