\section{Introduction}
  Consider the UC setting, with an environment $\mathcal{E}$, an adversary $\mathcal{A}$
  and a set of ITIs that follow a given protocol $\Pi$.

  Intuitively, players spontaneously feel different desires of varying intensities and
  seek to satisfy them, either on their own, consuming part of their input tokens in the
  process, or by delegating the process to other players and paying them for their help
  with part of their input tokens. The choice depends on the perceived difference in
  price and whether other players are trustworthy enough to satisfy the desire
  as promised. Each player plays rationally, always attempting to maximize her
  utility.
