\section*{Economic Trust}
  We would like to provide players with an API where they:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Entrust coins to another player
    \item Appropriate coins previously entrusted by another player
    \item Retract coins previously entrusted to another player
    \item Query trust towards another player
  \end{enumerate}
  The following functionality provides such an interface:
